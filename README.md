# REF/DIF 1 Model

REF/DIF is a phase-resolving parabolic refraction-diffraction model for ocean surface wave propagation. It was originally developed by Jim Kirby and Tony Dalrymple starting in 1982, based on Kirby's dissertation work. This work led to the development of REF/DIF 1, a monochromatic wave model.
